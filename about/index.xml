      <description>SharePoint Infrastructure SME with vast experience in Farm deployment since 2003. Why the Rambler? I grew up in the midwest in the 70s and one of the cars my family owned was a red American Motors Corporation (AMC) Rambler - it was a POS! However, it did get us where we needed to go. I am also a rambler - I tend to ramble on about things I am passionate about or would like to share with others!</description>
